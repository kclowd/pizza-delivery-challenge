/* 
Part 2:
The next day, to speed up the process, Maria rents a pizza-delivering goat named Clovis. 
Maria and Clovis begin at the same starting location, and they both deliver a pizza to this starting house. 
Maria and Clovis then take turns moving based on the dispatcherâ€™s instructions.

Here are some examples:

^v now delivers pizzas to three houses; Maria goes north and Clovis goes south.

^>v< now delivers pizzas to three houses; Maria and Clovis both end up back where they started.

^v^v^v^v^v now delivers pizzas to 11 houses; Maria treks north and Clovis treks south.

Given the same string of dispatcher inputs as in Part One, how many houses receive at least one pizza?
